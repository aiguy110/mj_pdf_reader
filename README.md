## What is different from PDF Viewer Plus
After the launch of MJ PDF, Gokul Swaminathan discontinued PDF Viewer Plus app. 
And he [suggested](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/PdfViewer#anouncement) MJ PDF as a replacement.
MJ PDF V2.0 codebase is 400% larger than PDF Viewer Plus without counting the libraries forked for MJ PDF, while being a quarter of its size.
[See changelog](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/change_log.md)


## Underlying Libraries
I Forked [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/barteksc/PdfiumAndroid) to update its core libraries that were years behind and had too many security vulnerabilities.
And Forked [ AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) to add features (like extracting PDF text) and modify some of its behavior (like scroll handle).

* Updated PDFium to 117.0.5921.0 (in v2.1.0) ([source code](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main), [building script](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries))
* Updated libpng to 1.6.39 ([source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.37/), [building script](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/build_dependencies/libpng.py))
* Updated Freetype to 2.13.0 ([source code](https://github.com/freetype/freetype), [building script](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/build_dependencies/freetype2.py))
