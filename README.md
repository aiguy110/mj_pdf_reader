## What is different from PDF Viewer Plus
[See changelog](https://gitlab.com/mudlej_android/mj_pdf_reader/-/blob/main/changelog.md)

## Forking PdfiumAndroid
I Forked [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/barteksc/PdfiumAndroid) to update its core libraries that were years behind and had too many security vulnerabilities.

* Updated PDFium to 106.0.5241.0 ([source code](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main), [building script](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries))
* Updated libpng to 1.6.37 ([source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.37/), [building script](https://github.com/kota-kota/libpng-build))
* Updated Freetype to 2.12.1 ([source code](https://github.com/freetype/freetype), [building script](https://github.com/kota-kota/freetype-build))

## Text Mode and Search
EDIT: This has changed in v1.4.3, this section talks about the previous versions

These were challenging to add, and they are still experimental. (especially Text Mode)
The problem was that PdfiumAndroid doesn't provide an option to extract text from the PDF. (even though PDFium does AFAIK)
And to make things more problematic, android-pdf-viewer renders the PDF file as bitmap images.
So, there is no way to search text. And if you did it somehow, you can't mark the results.

To overcome these obstacles, I added a new library (PdfBox-Android) that will work in the background 
as soon as the pdf is loaded to extract its text, then save it in a pageNumber:pageText map.

Then, I use it to search for the text. It works so far, but it doesn't find sentences spread over two pages.
I will try to fix that later. But the bigger problem was how to show the user the result? I can navigate
to the page of the result via pageNumber, but there is no way - that I'm aware of - to mark the result on the page.

To help the user find the result, I created a simple list that contains the line numbers of each result 
after calculating them by counting previous newlines (\n) characters.

Then, I create a snackbar that will be shown when the app navigates to the result page and won't go away
until the user dismiss it. That snackbar has enough information for the user to find the result in the page.

It tells him the line that has the result and its number in the page. 
e.g. (Line 25 - Page 12) -> this is {query} text...
The helping will start from the begging of the line to make it easier to find the line.

Text mode works in a similar fashion.
The pageNumber:pageText map of the PDF gets passed to TextModeActivity, then it displays 
all of the pages continuously in a textView.

There is two options to increase / decrease the font of the textView in the action bar.
There is a search option to look up any string in the textView. But here, results will be marked 
by a red color. (It's still under heavy development and may crash or work improperly)
